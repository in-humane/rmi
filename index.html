            <h2>Information</h2>
            <p>Our project explores the enduring legacy of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery "except as a punishment for crime," and its transformation into what we recognize today as our justice system. Through our photo gallery titled "Prison Labor in the South," we aim to shed light on the emotional, psychological, and physical toll of incarceration on marginalized populations, particularly within the Southern United States. This gallery combines historical photographs, investigative journalism, and personal accounts to reveal how systems of oppression have evolved rather than disappeared.</p>
            <p>Although the abolition of slavery marked a turning point in American history, the loophole within the 13th Amendment was used to excuse the continuation of forced labor and exploitation of primarily Black individuals. The prison system became a legal system of racialized oppression. Incarcerated individuals were forced into performing uncompensated labor, subjected to medical neglect, and relegated to inhumane living conditions, leaving many hopeless.</p>
            <p>Through imagery and storytelling narratives, our gallery seeks to evoke the emotional weight of these experiences. Photographs depict prisoners enduring physical torment, medical neglect, and labor reminiscent of plantation slavery, while accompanying narratives highlight the systemic failures that dehumanize and exploit incarcerated individuals.</p>
            <p>By showcasing this visual and historical narrative, we hope to foster a deeper understanding of how the carceral system functions as a modern extension of slavery. Our goal is not only to hold a space of undivided compassion to honor the resilience of those who endured these atrocities but also to provoke personal critical reflection and advocacy for systemic change. The gallery serves as a reminder that true abolition requires more than just reforming an exploitative system‚Äîit demands creating structures focused on care, rehabilitation, and providing the resources necessary for justice and dignity for all Americans.</p>
